## Getting Help

We have an irc channel on the freenode network. Join *#retro* on

have large idle times, but the channel is logged (see
http://rx-core.org/dev/rancid) and we generally try to answer
questions in a reasonible time period.

You can also ask questions on the mailing list. Signups, and a
